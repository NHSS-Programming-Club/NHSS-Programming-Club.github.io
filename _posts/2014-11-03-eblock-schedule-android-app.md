As per request of some teachers in our school, we have decided to make a simple E-Block schedule android app. 

E-Block is a period in our school day where students can take classes or make up work with any teacher that they want, but students have no simple way to access their schedule and see which teachers they have signed up with.

This app checks the school's eBlock database at http://nsdsql.nashua.edu/events/eblocklookup , and submits their student ID to fetch their classes so that the student can easily view them.

Future plans include:
<ul>
  <li>Adding notifications right before Eblock</li>
  <li>Update classes only once a week, instead of whenever the app is opened</li>
</ul>
